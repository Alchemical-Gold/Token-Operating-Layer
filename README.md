# **Token Operating Layer (TOL) ‚Äî Version 3.6**

**Token Operating Layer (TOL)** is a lightweight, browser-based interface that displays real-time token usage, cost, and estimated energy consumption (kWh) for prompts submitted to LLMs. It is designed for visibility, transparency, and efficient interaction between users and AI models.

This version, TOL v3.6, is the final frontend interface prototype before full API integration. It includes multi-model support, a built-in summarization meta-command, and a modular UI that reflects the principles of the forthcoming **Token-Aware Reasoning Interface (TARI)** system.

## üöÄ Key Features

### ‚úÖ **Live Token Preview & Tracking**

* Instant token estimation as you type.
* Live updates on:

  * Token count
  * Estimated cost (USD)
  * Estimated energy usage (kWh)
* CalculationsBased on model-specific rates and multipliers.

### ‚úÖ **Multi-Model Support**

* Supports:

  * GPT-4
  * GPT-3.5
  * Claude 3 Sonnet
* Dropdown model selector updates interface elements dynamically.

### ‚úÖ **Consistent Model Display**

* "Token Counter Log for: \[MODEL]" updates automatically.
* The second token block label now reflects selected model (e.g., ‚ÄúGPT-4 Tokens‚Äù).

### ‚úÖ **Summarize Session Meta-Command**

* A checkbox labeled "Summarize this chat session" enables users to request a session summary **without typing anything**.
* Demonstrates early-stage **TARI meta-command** execution.
* When checked, overrides manual input with a backend summary trigger.

  
### ‚úÖ 90% Token Usage Warning (Popup with Meta-Command Prompt)
‚Ä¢	When total token usage reaches 90% of the defined session limit, a modal popup appears.
‚Ä¢	Warns the user that the token cap is approaching.
‚Ä¢	Asks if they want to summarize the session before continuing.
‚Ä¢	Offers Yes/No buttons to trigger a summarization meta-command.

### ‚úÖ **Clean UI Layout**

* Right-aligned token preview and "Submit Query" button.
* Responsive layout designed for clarity and UX consistency.
* Fixed footer section for real-time Token Counter Log.

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

This project is now ready to be extended by open-source developers for full functionality.

Planned contributions include:

* API integration (OpenAI, Anthropic)
* Tokenizer backend (`tiktoken`, Claude tokenizer, etc.)
* Real backend summarization
* Token usage logging and export to `.csv` or `.json`
* Chrome extension packaging
* Sidebar UX for TARI command registry

About Me:

My Name is Derek DeMarco, this came about from issues I was having with all these LLMs, I was lost in LLM land, I didn‚Äôt know where I was, How many tokens I used, How many tokens were left, and how many was the LLM eating up‚Ä¶ Yeah I could just keep asking about the count using my tokens up in such a meta fashion, then I would want to know how many tokens was I using to find out about how many tokens I was using, a never ending loop of wasted tokens, and how much was this costing me in money and Carbon dioxide emissions. I need information from the LLM to operate the LLM properly to do my research efficiently, and I think this could help a lot of people.
This is part of a larger vision I have of a more ambitious complex user interface control structure, to control both the input and output using various font-end Advance Option Features (AOF) and back-end commands to reduce tokens usage, I put a test in as the sample check box, which uses far less, (about 2.5x less tokens) to generate a response coming from the command ‚ÄúSummarize chat‚Äù the back-3nds. costing about 2 tokens, meanwhile the front-end submission of the text ‚ÄúSummarize this chat session‚Äù, is about 5 tokens, coming from the front-end, just something to look forward to0, further optimization, increased accuracy more efficiency.

I am at a point of development, where this AI assisted coding has kinda reached my novice limits , and At this point its getting a bit to complex for me to get an API key, plug-in, and launch, that‚Äôs where I need that Help. 

There is much more that can be added such as logging and saving each individual interaction, logging token, token audit reports inheritance, ect., but I would like to focus on the next project.

So, I hand my project off to the community and the world.
